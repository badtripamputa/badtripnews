# CPP advises Duterte against pushing through with Marcos burial at Heroes' Cemetery

**Metro Manila (CNN Philippines)** — The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) sided with anti-Marcos groups in denouncing the [Supreme Court decision][1] to allow former President Ferdinand Marcos' burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. 

President Rodrigo Duterte stood firm that the late dictator should be interred at the Heroes' Cemetery because he was a former soldier and president.

But the CPP said in a statement that this move will be regarded as an act of contempt against the Filipino people.

"President Duterte must be advised against proceeding with such a plan. Such payment of political debt to the Marcoses will undoubtedly be regarded as an act of contempt against the Filipino people's historic judgment against the Marcos dictatorship," it said. 

The CPP, an ally of Duterte, said Duterte giving Marcos a hero's burial will mean virtually spitting on the graves of thousands of martyrs who fought to end the Marcos dictatorship. 

"If he proceeds in doing so, Duterte will bring to question his own assertions of being a Leftist considering that the Marcos dictatorship is the epitome of the anti-Left," CPP said. 

The CPP also advised the president against fulfilling his election promise to the Marcoses, which it said was made in exchange for financial and political support.

Duterte earlier said Marcos' daughter, Ilocos Norte Governor [Imee Marcos funded his presidential campaign][3]. But it was not disclosed in his Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE).

CPP said the broken promise will surely not sit well with the Marcoses, but the effect will be incomparable to the "deep indignation that will be stirred among the Filipino people."

It added that if Duterte allows Marcos' body to be moved from his mausoleum in Ilocos Norte and re-interred with hero's burial, he would have provided the Marcoses with the ultimate act of rehabilitation.
